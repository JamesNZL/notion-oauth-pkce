## Notion OAuth PKCE Proxy

This is a Notion OAuth PKCE proxy built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

Currently, the Notion API does not support PKCE entirely, so the only solution to use OAuth with your app is using a proxy like this.

The proxy server has been designed to follow the auth flow detailed [on this page](https://jamesnzl.notion.site/notion-assignment-import-c3a8c6f233de439e8f5e903826e78bd9). It may need some tweaks to adapt it to your use case, so use it as an starting point.

## Configuration

Create an `.env.local` file using the environment variables from the `.env.template` and fill in your own values.

Here is an example using [Notion Assignment Import](https://github.com/JamesNZL/notion-assignment-import) as the client:

```
CLIENT_ID=Notion OAuth Client ID
CLIENT_SECRET=Notion OAuth Client Secret
PROXY_REDIRECT_URL=https://oauth.jamesnzl.xyz/api/notion/code
CLIENT_REDIRECT_URL=https://oauth.jamesnzl.xyz/api/notion/access-token
NOTION_AUTHORIZE_URL=https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/authorize
NOTION_TOKEN_URL=https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/token
REDIRECT_URIS=https://elbkjcjgakaoccocmbglokgmalkoacie.chromiumapp.org/oauth, https://7e9f954a96941fe75f6a7ebc65e530350aafaf53.extensions.allizom.org/oauth
```

> The `redirect_uri` of your app, to which to send the temporary `code` grant, must be prelimiarily registered in `REDIRECT_URIS` to [prevent open redirector attacks](https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/redirect-uris/redirect-uri-registration/).  
> This is a `, ` delimited list, to accomodate use cases where your app may have a number of different redirect URLs.  
> The `redirect_uri` must be entered exactly as it will be passed to `/api/notion/authorise`, and does not support pattern matching for security reasons.

## Run locally

To run the proxy locally start the project with the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

After that you may want to expose your localhost using [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com) or a similar service to test your integration.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy the proxy is using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) from the creators of Next.js.
